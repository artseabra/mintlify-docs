## Get started in four simple steps

Building your Coppr profile is easy. Our effortless web-app requires **nothing to download**—just log in and you're ready to create your digital identity.

### Step 1: Log in to your dashboard

Access your Coppr dashboard by logging in with your credentials. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one quickly and easily.

<Accordion icon="user" title="First time logging in?">
  Creating an account takes just a moment. Simply provide your email address, create a secure password, and you'll be ready to start building your profile.

### Step 2: Upload a few of your best photos

Your visual presence matters. Upload a selection of your best photos that represent you professionally and personally. These images will be featured in your Coppr Link and help create that important first impression.

<Tip>
  Quality over quantity! A few great photos work better than many mediocre ones. Choose images that tell your story authentically.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Write a quick bio about yourself

Tell your story in your own words. Write a bio that captures who you are, what you do, and what makes you unique. This is your chance to connect with your audience on a personal level.

  Keep it authentic and engaging. Mention your profession, your passions, and what drives you. Remember: this is often the first thing people see, so make it count!

### Step 4: Link up your most important links

Connect your most important links to your Coppr profile. Whether it's your portfolio, social media, portfolio, or other professional resources—these links help people discover more about you.
